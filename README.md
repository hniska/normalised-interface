#### normalised-interface

Example of a NSO data provider for operational data (config false) written in python.

The data provider will try to provide a normalised view of different device types interfaces.

It doesnt work in the current release of NSO (4.7) without some small python API changes, the changes needed can be found in the application.py in the test folder.
